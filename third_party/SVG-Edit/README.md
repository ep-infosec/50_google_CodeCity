SVG-edit is a fast, web-based, javascript-driven SVG drawing editor that works in any modern browser.

## Demo

### [Try SVG-edit here](https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-editor.html)

(Also available as a [download](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit/releases/download/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-edit-2.8.1.zip) in [releases](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit/releases)).

You may also try the [pre-release](https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-3.0.0-alpha.4/editor/svg-editor.html) (or the [ES6-Module](https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-3.0.0-alpha.4/editor/svg-editor.html) version, assuming a modern browser).

## Installation

Note that steps 1-2 below are only necessary if you wish to integrate
SVG-edit into your own npm package; otherwise, you can skip those steps
and instead of looking within `node_modules/svgedit`, look within your
copy of the svgedit Git repo.

1. Set up an npm package of your own: `npm init` (complete the fields).
1. Install SVG-edit into your package: `npm i svgedit`
1. Copy `svgedit-config-sample-es.js` (in the SVG-edit project root;
    see `node_modules/svgedit`) to `svgedit-config-es.js`.
  1. This will enable `svg-editor-es.html` to work, an HTML file directly
    using ES6 modules. Note that this file only works on modern browsers.
    The config file now imports the SVG edit code, minimizing the scripts
    that need to be referenced in the HTML file.
1. To also build a rolled-up, Babelified, non-ES Modules (IIFE)
  JavaScript file which will allow `svg-editor.html` to work, a file
  which does not rely on ES6 Modules support, follow these steps:
  1. Run `npm install` within the `node_modules/svgedit` directory to
    install the build tools for SVG-edit.
  1. Run `npm run build-config` within the `node_modules/svgedit` directory.
1. If you wish to make changes to the HTML, modify `svg-editor-es.html` and
  then run `npm run build-html` to have the changes properly copied to
  `svg-editor.html`.
