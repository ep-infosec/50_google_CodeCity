This database contains the latest release of the official Code City
Core.  Normally, when creating a new instance, the database should be
initialised by reading all these files in, in order, into the new
server.  This will normally be accomplished by symlinking them into
the /database/ directory, making sure that no .city files are present
in that directory, then starting the server using
database/codecity.cfg.

The following naming convention has been established to keep things
organised:

core_0?_*.js - ES5.1 (and later) polyfills / JS base language stuff.
core_1?_*.js - Base structure & utilities ($, $.utils, etc.)
core_2?_*.js - Web servers, editors, etc.
core_3?_*.js - Physical world infrastructure, telnet server, etc.
core_4?_*.js - Start room, demos, etc.

test_??_*.js - Any tests to be run against the database.
