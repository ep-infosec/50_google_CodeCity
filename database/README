On startup, if no .city database file exists, the server will read and
execute all .js files in this directory in asciibetical order.  The
following naming convention has been established to keep things
organised:

core*.js - The Code City core.
db*.js   - A dumped databse, if available, less core.
test*.js - Any tests to be run against the databse.
